##INGREDIENTS
 
* 4 large wholewheat tortillas or corn tortillas
* 150 g of leek
* 1 tin of jack fruit – 400g drained weight 250g
* 2 tbsp of tamari
* 150 g of roasted red pepper in a jar
* 1 lemon
* 1/2 tsp salt
* ¼ tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp sweet paprika
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* ½ tsp smoked paprika
* 1 red chilli
* 1 avocado
* 1 x 400g can of full fat coconut milk
* 100 g vegan cheddar style cheese
* 1tsp of salt

##INSTRUCTIONS
 
1. Place the can of coconut milk in the fridge or freezer.
2. Drain and rinse the jack fruit and chop or wrip into thin slices
3. Finley slice the leeks including the greens and give them a good wash as often sediment can hide in the layers. Heat a non stick frying pan on high heat and once hot add 1 tbsp of oil and the sliced leek along with a pinch of salt and the jackfruit. Allow to cook for 5 mins stirring occasionally. Add 2 tbsp of tamari and mix through to add flavour to the jackfruit.
4. Add the salt, black pepper, sweet and smoked paprika, garlic powder to the pan and mix well.
5. Next take the can of coconut milk out and just remove the cream from the top and none of the water.
6. Add this coconut cream on top of the leek along with the juice of ½ lemon and mix through, and allow it to cook for a further 2-3 mins stirring occasionally.
7. Remove the peppers from the brine and slice into strips and keep separate.
8. Cut the avocado in half and remove the stone, scoop out the flesh and on a chopping board slice into long strips.
9. Grate the vegan cheddar style cheese.
10. Finely slice the red chilli
11. Taste the creamed leek and jack fruit and season to your liking, remove from the pan and give the pan a quick clean and wipe dry.
12. Put the same pan back on a medium heat and add a tortilla and allow to heat up for 30 seconds, onto the whole tortilla add a handful of vegan cheddar style cheese, on one half of the tortilla add add a good dollop of the creamed leek and jack fruit (approx ¼ it), a few slices of the red peppers, a few slices of the avocado, add a few slices of chilli and sprinkle with a tiny bit more vegan cheese. Fold over the top and allow to cook for a further minute. Carefully flip the tortilla over so the cheese side is facing the heat and allow to cook for a further minute until the tortilla starts to crisp up and the cheese starts to melt.
13. Remove from the heat and slice into quarters, repeat with the rest of the tortillas and filling and enjoy!
